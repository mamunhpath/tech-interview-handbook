title: Choosing between companies
---

After pass the interviews and if have received multiple offers, congratulations on the feat! Now you're faced with yet another problem (albeit a good one!) of choosing between companies. Here we will provide some insights into the factors you should be considering when deciding on the company to join. Everyone is different and certain factors matter more/less to others, so only you can decide what is best for you.

Do your due diligence by researching on the companies before deciding!

## Compensation

First and foremost, compensation. Most technical roles at tech companies would receive compensation in similar components - Base salary, Bonuses, Stocks, and Sign On. The [Understanding Compensation](./understanding-compensation.md) section goes into more detail. Some companies are more flexible in their offer and allow candidates to choose between higher base salary or higher stocks. Base salary is the most straightforward to understand and you are being paid that same amount regardless of how well/poorly the company is doing. Bonuses are also usually a percentage of the base salary, so a high base salary is great for the risk-adverse.

Not all stock grants are equal as well. Some companies have linear vesting cycles (you vest the same amount every year), some companies like Amazon and Snap have backloaded schemes (you vest less in the earlier years, more later), and there are pay attention to cliffs as well. [Stripe and Lyft](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/stripe-and-lyft-speed-up-equity-payouts-to-first-year) recently changed their stock structure and announced that they will speed up equity payouts to the first year. This sounds good initially, [but in reality there are some nuances](https://tanay.substack.com/p/employee-compensation-and-one-year).

Regardless of company, **always negotiate** your offer, especially if you have multiple offers to choose from! Having multiple offers in hand is the best bargaining chip you can have for negotiation and you should leverage it. We go into this more in the [Negotiation](./negotiation) section.

## Products

What does the company work on and is the company working on a domain you are interested in? Most big tech companies have teams working on all sorts of products. For these big tech companies, common products include ads networks, chat, enterprise offerings, video watching, payments, hardware products, industry-leading AI tools, internal tools, etc. Microsoft, Amazon, Apple and ByteDance have products in some of these areas as well. For many big companies, they are large enough that they build their our own infra and internal tools for most technologies they use because most existing technologies on the market can't meet their scale.

That said, each tech company is uniquely known for something and it's in their DNA. So if you are interested in specific areas and you are sure you can be able to work on them, the choice should be clearer:

- Meta - Social networks (FB, IG), Chat (WhatsApp, Messenger), VR stuff (Oculus)
- Google - Search, Browsers, Maps, Cloud infrastructure (Google Cloud Platform), Google Suite
- Amazon - Cloud infrastructure (Amazon Web Services), e-commerce
- Microsoft - Operating Systems, Microsoft Office Suite
- Apple - Hardware, Operating Systems, Services (iCloud, Apple Music)

Personally I feel more motivated and productive if I'm working on products which I use as an external user as well, as I have a better understanding of the product from a user perspective which can potentially lead to better engineering and product decisions.

### Prospective Teams

While a company can be working on various products, some products are only worked on in certain offices.For example, Google Singapore primarily works on Payments and if you're only interested in working on search, Google Singapore wouldn't be that great of a fit (although it is definitely a possibility to transition to another part of the company in future).

Do find out what products and teams your intended location works on so that you have a better idea of how your potential working life looks like if you were to join that company.

## Company Prospects

If you are awarded stocks, the company's prospects will affect your compensation! Is the company poised to be successful in the coming years or are there factors hindering the company's progress?

## Career Growth

How fast does the company promote its employees and does the company provide opportunities for its employees to grow? In smaller companies, you will get to wear multiple hats and build many products from 0 to 1. It's great for people who like to grow their product building skills and launch products quickly. However, technical growth might be limited due to the company's focus on product work and less on building infrastructure, which is usually only needed at scale. There's little need for a Principal Engineer in a small startup of 10 people where everyone is scrambling to build products. Career growth might be limited by the size and scope of the company and its suite of products.

Some companies promote their employees faster than the others. There's a saying that go to Google to rest and vest, go to Meta if you want to accelerate your career. I've found this to be quite accurate from what I experienced and looking at my peers at Google. At Meta, engineers are required to get from E3 to E4 within 2 years and E4 to E5 within 3 years. On the other hand, Google has a slower promotion cycle - the average engineer at Google takes more than 2 years to get from L3 to L4, more than 3 years to get from L4 to L5 and more than 4 years to get from L5 to L6. At Google the terminal level is L4 so there's no pressure to promote. None of my peers are L6 at Google but a few are already E6 at Meta and it is quite achievable. I think Google is a great place to learn to be excellent engineers. They require everything to be well-engineered, with design docs and full test coverage.

## Work-Life Balance

How long are employees required to work each week? How fast does the company move? How stressful is it to work at the company? Some Chinese companies famously [require employees to work 6 days a week](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinese-tech-workers-disclose-working-hours-criticism-996-2021-10-14/).

Google is famous for being a company for moving slower and more senior folks to go rest-and-vest (your stocks) while [Microsoft scores a C+ for Work Life Balance](https://www.comparably.com/companies/microsoft/work-life-balance) in an employee survey.
